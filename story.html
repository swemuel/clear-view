    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 6rem;">My Story</h1>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      After working in ECE Education for over 17 years I discovered so much about human development that fascinated me. It drew me to want to understand more about what makes us as humans tick.
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Like many people my childhood was not the picture perfect warm fuzzy environment ideally suited for optimal development. I learned adult self-destructive ways of being and doing, which shaped some of my sense of self that I’d started to form from a young age.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      The best thing I ever did was to go to university/ teachers college and learn about human development, discovering ways of being that positively impact child development. Things started to make sense to me, why people are the way they are. I discovered so much by delving into all the impacting factors that shape us as human beings.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Can we as adults change our path? ABSOLUTELY!
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Do we have to continue to travel the well-worn self-destructive path of our parents and grandparents before us? NO WE DON’T!
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Can we develop our voice, our sense of self, our wellbeing, self-care, self-love, and self-worth? SING IT LOUD! YES WE CAN!
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I have learned over time that the more I suppress my true self the more my physical, emotional and spiritual body suffers.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I burnt out a few years ago, trying so hard to be a people pleaser, trying to be someone that others wanted me to be, to fit their mould.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I went down the path of seeing doctors and specialists trying to discover why I was so ill, why I felt so faint and dizzy, with zero energy and full of anxiety. Breather testing picked up I had something called SIBO - Small intestinal Bacteria overgrowth.  Doctors and specialists really didn’t understand it and a strong antibiotic was their only solution.  I knew there were underlying issues at play causing these symptoms.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I researched a lot trying to find the answers. Specialists and doctors were drawing my bank account and my sense of self belief that I could ever start to feel better.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I discovered many alternative natural health therapies during this time from EAV treatment with Megan Wang in Ohoka, just the best way to discover how your organs are functioning and pick up any underlying allergies you may have. She discovered I had adrenal fatigue.  I saw a Naturopath, Medical Herbalist, and a Kinesiologist who picked up on my gut issues straight away. She was specific with the area of my small intestine not functioning properly. I had Visceral Manipulation with Rosie Greene in Clarkville. Havening and Tapping with Angela Frewer in Leithfelid, Reiki with Sandra McAlpine in Fernside, and Mindfulness with Kate Brandram-Adams.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I needed to take charge and find what worked best for me. Havening gave me a sense of control to help with my emotions, by releasing the past crap and replacing it with strength and feelings of capability. This gave me a way to take control of my anxious thoughts and come out on top.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Changing my diet, introducing quality pre and probiotics specific to my needs, as well as making Zinc a stable in my routine have all helped. Cutting out processed foods and especially refined sugars also helped to heal my gut as well as support my levels of anxiety. Turning to organic foods and using natural cleaning products around the house have all helped as well.  All the while I was gaining in the knowledge that my body was absorbing everything, emotional and physical, and that maybe we really aren’t meant to absorb all the artificial chemical crap we use in our daily lives.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I could account the times when I was at the peak of my illness and had been gifted a massage. I was so on edge that I struggled to relax enough to benefit from it. I look back now and wish I had treated myself weekly to a relaxing massage way before I got to that point, what a difference it would have made to my overall wellbeing.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I have learnt so much from my personal journey especially the importance of self-kindness, and even the way I talk to myself.  Society can be critical of self-care often with the attitude, ‘we should be putting everyone else first’, and ‘it’s selfish to put money and time into you.’  Well I say bullshit to this! It’s time to recognise what our bodies, our minds and our souls need, then and only then we will fill that elusive ‘full bucket’ allowing us to give and love others the way we truly authentically wish to.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I have watched women over the years whether they are educated or not continue to be in a cycle of abuse, for all the right reasons for them at that time.  I believe if we can share these ways of being when children are young whether it is as young as ECE, primary or secondary school to teach the most important life skills like how to develop self-worth, self-care and self-love, wow what an impact this would have on society.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Reiki is a beautiful modality that is all about the sharing of energy used to help move negative energies built up in the body. The scientific healing powers of touch have been well researched and Reiki is now used as a healing modality in hospitals all over the world to help speed up recovery in patients.
    </h3>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Mindfulness and CBT therapy are both ways we can look at our thoughts and beliefs in an empowering way recognizing that they don’t own us, we are the ones who have power over them. Our thoughts are not who we are. Now we can turn the tide of negativity through kindness, playfulness, honesty and vulnerability in a safe caring nurturing place of self-responsibility.
