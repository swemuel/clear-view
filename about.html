    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 6rem;">What is Reiki?</h1>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Reiki literally means universal <strong>life force energy</strong>.
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      It’s an energy shifting practice that brings together healing, love, balance and harmony. Channelling energy through me to you. I’ve been given the attunements to help the reiki flow through me to you as I work with your chakras. The chakra system refers to the energy centres we all have in our bodies. There are 7 major chakras each having a specific location and purpose, Crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacral, and root or base chakras.
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Some of the benefits of reiki are that it can aid relaxation, relieve pain, and can accelerate natural healing.
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Our bodies project our thoughts and those thoughts and beliefs can manifest into reality. Every thought carries energy, good or bad. Energy is real, it’s alive and kicking. There’s so much research out there that looks into good energies and how they support growth and development not only with human beings but any living thing.
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Scientific research talks about the benefits of touch and how the synapses in the brain actually grow with touch especially in babies. There are studies showing that touch signals safety and trust, it soothes. Basic warm touch calms cardiovascular stress. It activates the body's vagus nerve, which is intimately involved with our compassionate response, and a simple touch can trigger release of oxytocin, aka “the love hormone.”
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Physical touch increases levels of dopamine and serotonin; two neurotransmitters that help regulate your mood and relieve stress and anxiety. Dopamine is also known to regulate the pleasure centre in your brain that can offset feelings of anxiety.
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      I will work over your main chakra points, holding my hands on or above some of the points feeling for temperature differences, and focusing energy to those points. I will use the reiki symbols in my hands to activate the vibration, helping to shift built up energy.
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Reiki has been around for over 100 years with Dr Mikao Usui developing a method for healing that was unattached to any specific religion and belief, so that it would be accessible to everyone.
